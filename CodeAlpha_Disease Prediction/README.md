# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has **heart disease** based on clinical and demographic features.  
**CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a Machine Learning model that can accurately classify patients as:
- **0 → No Heart Disease**
- **1 → Heart Disease Present**

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Target Variable:** `target`
- The original column `num` was converted into a binary target.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Encoding categorical features  
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
5. Training a Random Forest Classifier  
6. Evaluating model performance  
7. Making predictions on new data
